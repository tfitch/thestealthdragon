The guy who gets doubled teamed and makes nice assists to wide open team mates on the crease got his second NLL Transition Player of the Week award of the season.  Maybe if he would have scored on <a href="http://twitpic.com/yd2ay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this shot</a> instead of toeing the crease after dodging past Brodie Merrill he would have gotten the award in Week 2 as well.  Most people see winning the NLL Transition Player of the Week every other week as good.  I see it as &#8220;room for improvement&#8221;.  Good work <a href="http://twitter.com/PaulRabil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PaulRabil</a>.

And how about that <a href="http://twitter.com/rat42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis Ratcliff</a> guy.  He likes going back to Calgary, where he started his NLL career and played for 7 seasons.
