Hello, my name is Tyler and I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.stealthlax.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><del datetime="2009-12-01T06:20:34+00:00">San Jose</del> Washington Stealth</a> and San Francisco Dragons (deceased) fan and season ticket holder.Â  I go to as many Stealth games as I can every season and watch everything else that I can on TV or online. In 2008 and 2009 I had season tickets to both the San Jose Stealth and Portland Lumberjax. Now it&#8217;s just the Washington Stealth.

Watching all that lax gets a few thoughts in my head and I&#8217;m going to put them here.
