We&#8217;ve got the same team in a home and home series. So no need for two separate write ups.

The first game is in Colorado on Thursday. It&#8217;s our first Thursday game that I can recall the Stealth playing in. We should travel well, our team is young not as ingrained in their jobs. The ability to travel before the weekend shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an issue. Comparatively Colorado has played a couple Thursday games already and had trouble getting the core roster to show up. If, for some reason, this were to happen again it&#8217;ll be in the Stealth&#8217;s favor. Colorado had last weekend off, so maybe all the affected players put some extra work in to clear their time for this weekend.

The playoff seedings in the West are all still up for grabs. If we sweep the Mammoth and Arizona beats Calgary and Minnesota they could actually move all the way to first place. I don&#8217;t see that happening, we&#8217;ll win one which will be a good statement that we can play at that level. With one win Colorado locks in first in the West. Because of that, they&#8217;ll really go for the win on Thursday to eliminate the requirement that they \_have\_ to win on Friday against a team that would have just beaten them the night before.

Then for second place, Arizona is sitting pretty, but not locked in. With two losses and two wins by us we could pass them. This is the least likely scenario. So Arizona is second.

Now third place. We&#8217;ve got it now, but if we lose two and and Calgary wins one we could lose it and drop to fourth.

Finally in fourth it is still open to Calgary and Edmonton. If Edmonton wins both they&#8217;re in. Edmonton loses one and they&#8217;re out. Calgary wins both and they&#8217;re in. I think if Calgary just wins on Friday and Edmonton has to win both to take fourth.

So lots can happen, and it&#8217;ll start on top with our games.

Since the seeding is not yet secured I don&#8217;t think Colorado will rest anyone&#8230; on Thursday. But if they lock up first and then have to play on the road were we can beat on their players for the edification of the fans, then they might choose to rest a couple stars. Gallant and Nash have been injured of late, the rest would do them good. If all goes well and we an beat them on Thursday and force them to play both nights, that&#8217;ll slow their comebacks.

The first game is on Thursday, around here it&#8217;d probably keep the attendance low because people wouldn&#8217;t expect to go on a day other than Friday or Saturday. But the Colorado fans are savvy and even if it&#8217;s lacrosse, they&#8217;ll fill The Can on a Thursday night. The Colorado players love it but our players will also love it. The energy from a crowd that size will motivate our players as well, not just the Mammoth. Since it&#8217;s direct for the Mammoth it&#8217;ll help them more, but our players are looking forward to it.

I already touched on Gee Nash and John Gallant&#8217;s health. They&#8217;re dinged up and working on getting back to 100%. On our end Burkholder is still recovering after a knee strain in Portland almost a month ago. Last week he was about 70%, which explains why he hasn&#8217;t been explosive in doing his one on one moves of late. I&#8217;d like to see him rested this weekend since we&#8217;ve made the playoffs. Seeding for us isn&#8217;t more important than his health, but making the playoffs kind of was. We&#8217;ve achieved that goal and can rest that one man.

I think the key match up for the games won&#8217;t be individual but as a group. The Mammoth defense against the Stealth offense. I&#8217;m proud of our attack and how we have four capable weapons to step up and lead the way any given night. They&#8217;re not potent and putting it in the net 12 or more times, but we score enough to win. The Mammoth have a group of defenders that can match up with all four guys at once. I really want to see what the result of these match ups is going to be. Will they shut us down or will we still be able to score and have a chance at winning? It could go either way and I can&#8217;t pick it. But it is what to watch for.

Finally, Jim Moss faces old team this week. He was the corner stone of the defense and the emotional leader of the entire team the past couple years. Now he&#8217;s gone. Moss sat out the first half of the season until we could trade him to Colorado for Burkholder and a 1st rounder. I don&#8217;t know what his motivation is though. He turned his back on us, not the other way around. He can&#8217;t be pissed and want to exact revenger, he turned is back on us. He didn&#8217;t like the direction the team was going, which is crazy talk. After two struggling year we made the playoffs this year. If he didn&#8217;t like the direction the team was going what did he want? To lose again? His argument is pretty weak.

The games are going to be very exciting. A lot is on the line. I think we&#8217;ll split the series. Each team wins at home. Colorado is first, Arizona is second, San Jose is third and Calgary is fourth. Then the playoffs begin and things will get really interesting.
