Round 3: Ding ding ding.

All the build up through the previous two matches is setting the table for a wonderful game tonight.

First and foremost we have to win so that we can head in to Saturday needing the one win to lock in our playoff spot.

Portland will be hungry to do their part to eliminate us from the playoffs and to save some pride after the two wins we put on them so far this season.

Most importantly, Portland wants to beat us up so we&#8217;re weaker against them and weaker tomorrow. Not very skillful, but that&#8217;s all they&#8217;ve got this year. The key thug will of course be Ray Goonze who had a fight with Rosy in the last round two weeks ago. He&#8217;s their fighter, we&#8217;ll see if he picks on someone a) his own size b) who&#8217;s actually a fighter and not just some scoring machine who&#8217;s pinned 14 points on your team in 2 games so far this season.

Normally as a team we&#8217;d have our thug/enforcer step in and speak for Rosy, but why? Rosy fought for himself last time and can do it again. Goonze proves nothing picking on the littler man. The Stealth are together as a team and I&#8217;m just as proud of them for having Rosy fight for himself as I would be if someone stepped up to protect him. I think tonight we&#8217;ll have our tough guy do the dirty work. I just don&#8217;t know who he is? I&#8217;m thinking either Shaydon or Kyle Sorenson. If Goonze wants to pick on an offensive guy his own size, Colin Doyle is waiting for him. That&#8217;ll be a fine match up.

I&#8217;m less sure about the Stealth winning this game. Johnny Mouradian already identified the key in his video preview. No penalties. If we don&#8217;t get any penalties tonight and get sucked in to the game that Portland wants to play we&#8217;ll destroy them. If we do battle then it&#8217;s 50/50 depending on how the penalties effect the line up.

But I&#8217;ll pick us to win. Ryan Powell (hyper-extended knee) might be out of the lineup tonight as well, which is about 1/4 of their scoring. Without him they&#8217;re really hurting.

Best case scenario we&#8217;ll win 15-6. Worst case it&#8217;ll be like last time, we&#8217;ll win 9-7.

I can&#8217;t wait.
