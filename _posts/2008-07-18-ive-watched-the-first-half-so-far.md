All right,

It&#8217;s mid-July and so far I&#8217;ve to get through the first half of the Jax first round playoff victory over the Stealth from two months ago.  It&#8217;s a rough experience to live through again, so I&#8217;m taking it really slow.

Luckily a good thing has happened since the season ended &#8211; Dan Dawson is no longer a Portland Lumberjax or even in the West Division at the moment.  This pleases me a great deal.  May he never return, or only return to the Stealth.

Unfortunately coach Walt Christianson was let go this week and Jeff Dowling was hired to replace him.  I&#8217;m very sad to see coach Walt go.  I&#8217;m not that familiar with the new coach Dowling, but I know some connections between him and GM Johnny Mouradian.  In 2007 during the season ticket holder special meeting with the GM and Coach I asked if the Stealth would be able to get Jarrett Park back after losing him in the expansion draft to the New York Titans.  Dowling was working for the NY Titans at the time and almost pulled off a deal to trade Park back to SJ but was hired by Calgary to be their replacement coach after they fired Chris Hall midseason.  Not surprisingly, the lacrosse community isn&#8217;t that big after all, Dowling and Mouradian have a history that has brought them together to the point that Mouradian replaced Christianson with Dowling.

I hope Johnny knows what he&#8217;s doing in replacing the head coach of the top team in the West.

Hopefully before the Draft in September I&#8217;ll finish the second half of the game.

BTW &#8211; the most interesting thing I learned actually related to the game is that in the summer Troy Cordingly plays Brodie Merrill as a forward in the summer as opposed the defense position he plays for Portland.  That helps explain why he&#8217;s all over the floor.
