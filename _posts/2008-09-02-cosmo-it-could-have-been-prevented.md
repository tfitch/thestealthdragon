I definitely needed to think about the Cosmo trade for several days before I felt I could write it up.  My main point of concern with the trade of Anthony Cosmo from San Jose to Chicago isn&#8217;t related to the movement of the players involved but the player was traded almost purely because he has a life outside of lacrosse.<figure id="attachment_85" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-85" style="width: 273px" class="wp-caption alignright">

If Cosmo made his living as a lacrosse goalie and only as a lacrosse goalie he would not have been traded to Chicago.  He would have said, I&#8217;ll take the California winters with my wife and my team and beat the holy hell outta all the other teams in the league.

Instead Cosmo is an elite goalie that has to schlep across the continent just to be the best.  And it&#8217;s hard to the best when you have to fly 3000 miles 24 hours before the games to prove it.

So in my opinion, this is a league issue.  Pay your players more and the players won&#8217;t be able to successfully get trades made so they can have a better life outside of lacrosse.  Unfortunately this is a budget issue, to my knowledge only two or three teams are making money.  So paying the players more is a Catch 22.  The only resolution to this comes from more fans attending games and more money in the pockets of the owners that&#8217;ll trickle down to the players.  To get more fans I think the team/leagues need better TV deals for more exposure to average sports fans.

So what I&#8217;m saying is this trade was preventable.  More TV + more fans + more money = No Cosmo trade.

I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re closer to your family, I&#8217;m very sad you&#8217;re not defending the Stealth cage in 2009.
