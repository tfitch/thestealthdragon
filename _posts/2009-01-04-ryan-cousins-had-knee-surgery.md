Ryan Cousins missed the Swarm season opener in Portland because he is recovering from knee surgery he had four weeks ago.  He warmed up today but did not play in the game.  I asked him about it after the game and he told me about having surgery four weeks ago and he&#8217;s still a week or two away from being ready to play.  I don&#8217;t know what type of surgery he had, just that it was knee surgery.  Since this is only the first week of twenty this season it was a prudent playing decision by coach Jacobs to not rush him back.

  What I didn&#8217;t find out about was Nick Patterson who also didn&#8217;t play.  If I remembered what he looked I maybe would have asked him at the bar.
