The Stealth have a great weekend ahead with home and home series against the Portland Lumberjax. So we&#8217;ll be cheering hard in SJ and PDX for the Stealth to win both games.

But there&#8217;s other action that is important to the Stealth this weekend and cheering in those games will help out too.

Saturday at 4:30 Pacific Time the Colorado Mammoth play at the Philadelphia Wings. A Mammoth loss is good for the Stealth, so let&#8217;s all do aÂ  W! I! N! G! S! WINGS!

Thirty minutes after that the red hot Calgary Roughnecks play at the Minnesota Swarm. The Swarm are in fourth place and the Stealth want to take that spot from them. A Roughnecks victory is needed on Saturday to help the Stealth out too.

Go Stealth Go! Go Wings and Go Roughnecks! Yep, go Roughnecks. Wait until next week when I&#8217;m cheering for Stealth on Friday night and the Lumberjax on Saturday April 4th to beat the Woolies. I may even wear plaid, I&#8217;m putting it in the car just case.

Finally, big **CONGRATULATIONS** to Paul Rabil on winning the NLL Tranny of the Week award for his effort against the Edmonton Rush. Paul&#8217;s been very comfortable working out the back door lately. Makes me wonder if Kevin Huntley would have won any NLL Weekly awards this season if he&#8217;d come out to play.
