Cosmo came out last month against the New York Titans with either a new helmet or new paint job. But he&#8217;s got a mean looking black helmet now. I noticed it right away but forgot to comment on it until just now when I started watching the first game of the season against Rochester. Now the old red helmet sticks out.

He&#8217;s really come alive since the new helmet came out. He&#8217;s also got the playing time now to make up for the time he missed during Training Camp. So the first four to six weeks when we were struggling corresponded to Cosmo getting warmed up. The past three games he&#8217;s been ready and up to the challenge.

Hopefully in the future he can make it to every week of training camp so that we don&#8217;t blow through a fourth of the schedule getting him back to full game readiness.
