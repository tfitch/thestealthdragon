In an attempt to help alleviate issues in finding the proper feed for the road games I&#8217;ve added a new page to the site that can be found in the top navigation called &#8220;[Watch the Stealth](http://thestealthdragon.com/?page_id=171)&#8220;. It will always have the Stealth feed on it where you can watch Stealth highlights, live Stealth home games and all previous 2009 Stealth home games On Demand. For road games I&#8217;ll rotate in the necessary feeds to watch the road games live.

I think the On Demand is the best feature.

  1. Click on the On Demand Button
  2. then click on Games on Demand >
  3. Now you&#8217;ll presented with the list of available games.

For road games you&#8217;ll have to go find the hosting teams page at http://www.mogulus.com/cityteam so /minnesotaswarm to see the Swarm and /calgaryroughnecks to see the Roughnecks game. I haven&#8217;t found 100% of the games to be available yet, but that is supposed to be the plan from the league.

Now no matter where the Stealth are playing, you can always watch their games on this page. Enjoy.
