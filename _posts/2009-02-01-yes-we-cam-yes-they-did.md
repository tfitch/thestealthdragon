Earlier this week the San Jose Stealth properly <a href="http://sjstealth.com/articles/view/212/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">featured Cam Sedgwick</a> and his do anything/everything attitude to make the Stealth better.  Congratulations to Cam (4 goals and 2 assists) and all the Stealth in their team domination of the Edmonton Rush today.  But I think the Stealth article was missing this.<figure id="attachment_164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164" style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
