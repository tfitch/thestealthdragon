What an exciting game to have missed. At least I saw last years game, which was very similar and an OT win for the Stealth. And I missed the game because I was at another game, which makes the miss bearable. If I had missed it for any other reason I&#8217;d be kicking myself.

Luke Wiles scored the game winning 13th goal. While I didn&#8217;t pick an overtime game I was very close to picking the score exactly, 12-11 instead of the actual 13-12 final. I think it was my closest guess yet for a Stealth game. And I also picked Curt Malawsky to be an x-factor and he had the final goal in regulation to send it to overtime. That was a pretty clutch goal by Mouse.

Since I did not see any of the action myself, here are the collection of articles talking about the game. There information is better than mine today.

The Stealth and Lumberjax are off this week. So I&#8217;ll see if I can find any games on TV, which I doubt because the Mammoth don&#8217;t have a home game for a couple of weeks.
