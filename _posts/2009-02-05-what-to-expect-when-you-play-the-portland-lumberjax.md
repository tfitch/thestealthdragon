In 2008, the [San Jose Stealth](http://www.sjstealth.com) did not match up well against the [Portland Lumberjax](http://www.portlandjax.com) losing 3 out of 4 matchups, including the playoffs. With Coach Derek Keenan returning at the helm, the Lumberjax have not changed their style of play from last year.<figure style="width: 105px" class="wp-caption alignright">

The Lumberjax&#8217;s strength is their physical style of defense. With the Morgan brothers, Brodie Merrill, and Bruce Murray on defense, the Lumberjax are the largest defensive squad in the NLL. However, I think the most effective Lumberjax defensive player has got to be #7, Tyler Codron. Codron is masterful in his ability to blanket cover the best offensive player on the opposing side. Another player to watch is Scott Stewart, who excels in transition sparking a goal or two in transition when he&#8217;s in the lineup.Â  One more thing regarding their transition game, everyone knows Brodie Merrill is fast, but Peter Morgan is unexpectedly fleet of foot as well.

On offense, the Lumberjax seem to rely heavily on Cory Conway who has been scoring regularly. Derek Malawsky, former Stealth forward, is patient and always manages to score a goal or two a game. Dan Stroup shoots from the outside and rebounds well. Peter Jacobs is quick and places the ball well when his hands are free. Ryan Powell, well, he&#8217;s Ryan Powell so if you don&#8217;t know his game by now, nothing I could say will help you. Peter Morgan and Brodie Merrill also see time on the offensive side and both use their size (tall and lanky) one-on-one and in the two-man game to their advantage.

In goal, the Lumberjax have been starting Matt Disher. Disher&#8217;s performance so far in 2009 has been stellar. He has been making crazy saves &#8211; from his knees, falling onto his side, and even from his back. I am just one more of the many NLL fans on the Disher bandwagon. To score on Disher, I recommend getting some luck. I would love to be able to say he&#8217;s weak on a type of shot, but seriously, the guy is playing out of his mind. A fake or two is necessary, and if you get him moving, watch out for his stick save! Maybe fake high and go five hole?

The faceoffs should be a good battle between #31 Will &#8220;Big Baby&#8221; Dalton and #12 Pat &#8220;I Carry a Gun at Work&#8221; Jones. Read the article  _[Facing Off with &#8220;Big Baby D&#8221;](http://www.sjstealth.com/articles/view/219/)_ for more information.

There are more fans at Lumberjax games than usually make it to HP Pavilion, but there won&#8217;t be as many as the Pepsi Center (Denver). Ryan Powell is great at getting the fans into the game, especially after he scores.

This is just one woman&#8217;s view on the Jax, but I think the Stealth can take &#8217;em.
