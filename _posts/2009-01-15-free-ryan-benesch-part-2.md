Huh, when I first said &#8220;[Free Ryan Benesch!](http://www.thestealthdragon.com/?p=124)&#8221; I meant it as in, let Benesch be free from the grips of Toronto.<figure id="attachment_150" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150" style="width: 189px" class="wp-caption alignright">

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-150" title="derek_suddons" src="http://www.thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/derek_suddons.jpg" alt="New Edmonton Rush Defender Derek Suddons" width="189" height="189" />](http://www.thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/derek_suddons.jpg)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-150" class="wp-caption-text">New Edmonton Rush Defender Derek Suddons</figcaption></figure> 

Apparently in Toronto it meant, take Ryan Benesch for free or best offer. GM/Coach Bob Hamley of Edmonton either made the first or best offer and picked up Benesch and Derek Suddons for a couple of draft picks. Suddons is a defender I&#8217;ve never heard of because the Rock don&#8217;t play Portland or San Jose but the Rock fans on the <a href="http://wingszone.com/nllmb/showthread.php?t=41609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wingszone forum</a> say they&#8217;re going to miss him and he one was of their top defenders. So Hamley got the better deal here.

I feel Toronto&#8217;s GM Mike Kloepfer didn&#8217;t read my post that he was in a better bargaining position here than the final result dictated. He could have and should have gotten more for those two guys than a 1st and 2nd round draft pick.
