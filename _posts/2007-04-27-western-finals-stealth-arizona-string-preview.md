Well, not too much different to be said about this match up than <a href="http://thestealthdragon.com/stealth-arizona-sting-review/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">the previous game there</a>.

The stakes have increased to a Division Title though. That&#8217;s just a little bit of incentive for both teams to win.

The Sting defense is possibly the best in the West. We&#8217;re the other competitor for that title. I think the winner of the game will take that distinction along with the Title.

We need to shutdown the secondary scorers, especially Curt Malawsky who beat up on us since we let him go last year. Dan Dawson will get his goals, hopefully we hold him to three.

On our offense, Colin Doyle will lead the way ago. Everything goes through him, 9 assists on our 15 goals last week. He&#8217;s the man and our leader. Hopefully he can show us how to win at least one more time this season.

Time to hit the road. I&#8217;m stoked for this trip. I promise to get the game review up on Monday and not a whole week later. Until then &#8211; cheers.
