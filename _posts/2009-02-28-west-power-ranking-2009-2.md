We&#8217;re back again with a mid season West Conference power rankings. This time around I recruited some of my left coast amigos from Portland and San Jose to get a broader range of input. So I&#8217;d like to thank Zeboim, Zmystere, RP=BA and laxinoregon for their assistance and comments to create these rankings. Like me, they all watch more games than just their home teams (thank you NLL for the Mogulus services this season) so I trust their judgement.

In talking with Zeboim I realized the goal of the list is not clearly defined for if it is A) How the teams are playing right now or B) How the West Division will finish. I&#8217;m leaning towards A and when I do another ranking in a month I&#8217;ll make that more clear.

**Scoring:** I had all participants rank the teams 1-6 and then I averaged out their scores to rank the teams. Their final average score is what is listed as their rank. No two rankings were identical and for the record, no fan of their own team picked them as the top team.

Finally &#8211; ranking does not account for the games already played on Friday February 27th.

**Calgary Rank: 1.4**<figure id="attachment_139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139" style="width: 100px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

**laxinoregon:** Rank: 1 &#8211; Sure they lost two in a row, they are still healthy and because of that they are a right scary team.  
**zymstere:** Rank: 2 &#8211; Because of their recent losses and the close games they have had all season. Campbell in cage has been average at best. As you mentioned before, they peaked at the beginning of the season and is one injury away from being a bottom feeder.  
**RP=BA:** Rank 1 &#8211; The Boston game doesn&#8217;t bug me that much, they&#8217;re just starting to round off a little after starting so hot. I&#8217;ve never been a huge Campbell guy so I have concerns there. They need to keep improving like the rest of the west and hope they haven&#8217;t peaked.  
 **Zeboim:** Rank 2 &#8211; I had Calgary ranked #1 until they had close losses in their last 2 games. The &#8216;Necks don&#8217;t seem to be able to handle playing against physical defense.  
**StealthDragon:** Rank 1 &#8211; The two losses were in close games and the wins were not that close. If they&#8217;re going to really be a league champion again I think they need to be able to close out a close game. Still, one injury away from being in major trouble on offense or defense.

**Portland Rank: 1.6**<figure id="attachment_155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155" style="width: 100px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

**laxinoregon:** Rank 2 &#8211; Best defense in the West. Only question is can Disher maintain his form for the remainder of the games. Disher goes down, good night Irene.  
**zymstere:** Rank 1 &#8211; Because the D has been consistent from game one and their O has been getting better each game. Morgan, Conway and Malawsky has been the back bone. Of course you can&#8217;t help but mention Merrill the human loose ball vaccum.  
**RP=BA:** Rank 2 &#8211; I was ready to stick the Mammoth here (#2) before they laid an egg this weekend. I&#8217;m concerned about the Wings game this weekend only because they&#8217;ve had so much time off and were playing so good before the layoff. This is the 2nd of a back to back though for Philly and the Jax know 1st place could be at stake.  
**Zeboim:** Rank 1 &#8211; Portland seems to score just enough points to win, but since wins and losses are what ultimately counts, they are doing what it takes. Defensively the Jax are strong, fast, and aggressive, overpowering most teams them play. Just for the record, while I think the Jax are the best in the west, I don&#8217;t like it!  
**StealthDragon:** Rank 2 &#8211; Maybe the best defense in the league. Size does matter when you can never get your hands free because a monster 6&#8217;5&#8243;+ defender is guarding you. Disher is surprising the heck outta me. Their offense learned a great deal from Dan Dawson that they&#8217;re applying to games this year now that he&#8217;s not there.

**San Jose Rank: 3.2**<figure id="attachment_132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132" style="width: 100px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-132" title="stealthlogo" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/stealthlogo.gif" alt="San Jose Stealth" width="100" height="100" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/stealthlogo.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-132" class="wp-caption-text">San Jose Stealth</figcaption></figure> 

**laxinoregon:** Rank 3 &#8211; At 3-4 San Jose is better than their record, but not by much. They still have a lot of questions concerning their defense, but they are starting to gel together.  
**zymstere:** Rank 3 &#8211; Stealth had their most complete game on both sides of the floor. The cast of rookies are improving with every shift. Gillespie, Hartzell and Manney have been more than capable and it showed this weekend against the Mammoth. The addition to McKinlay and Veltman now available for the roster will only help the D/T. O has been solid with contributions from Doyle, Wick, Duch and TJ not to mention Cam. The current trip to NY & Boston should help prove this point.  
**RP=BA:** Rank 4 (_StealthDragon note: hater_)- This was a tough pick for me but the Stealth have been playing really well as of late. I still think Roik is too much of a headcase when other teams make runs, that will always hurt the Stealth in close games and the D is young and fairly inexperienced. Love the offense though, I&#8217;d take SJ&#8217;s O over Calgary&#8217;s even.  
 **Zeboim:** The Stealth just beat Colorado, and thus I can&#8217;t rank San Jose below the Mammoth. However, the Stealth have no close wins, which is concerning as we head into the back half of the season.  
**StealthDragon:** They can&#8217;t move up until they beat one of the teams above and they don&#8217;t get to play Calgary again&#8230; Double header against Eastern teams this weekend to lock up some out of conference victories.

**Colorado Rank: 4**<figure id="attachment_153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153" style="width: 100px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-153" title="colorado" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/colorado.gif" alt="Colorado Mammoth" width="100" height="100" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/colorado.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-153" class="wp-caption-text">Colorado Mammoth</figcaption></figure> 

**laxinoregon:** Rank 4 &#8211; What is their identity? In years past it was crisp offensive excecution and transition. Now both are gone, and it&#8217;s all down hill.  
**zymstere:** Rank 4 &#8211; Colorado is still a dangerous team and with them playing at the can will help stabilize their struggles. Leyson may loose his position as #1 tender. Colorado needs to re-group from a horrible weekend and Pawlidor may be the answer. Langtry and Prout will need to get things going if they want a spot in the playoffs.  
**RP=BA:** Rank 3 &#8211; Starting to finally take shape. Prout is playing better, Langtry is aggressive and will score, and Danowski has been huge for them. The Gajic injury is gonna come back to bite them especially now with Ward out too. I still don&#8217;t buy into Leyshon as a playoff contender.  
**Zeboim:** Rank 5 &#8211; Speaking as a Stealth fan, Colorado should be in last place, but Minnesota&#8217;s five losses in a row can&#8217;t make that happen so I am putting them at #5. They have a few key injuries that have disrupted their productivity.  
**StealthDragon:** Rank 4 &#8211; They&#8217;re either hot or cold, but more cold than hot it seems.

**Edmonton Rank: 5.2**<figure id="attachment_154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154" style="width: 100px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-154" title="edmonton" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/edmonton.gif" alt="Edmonton Rush" width="100" height="100" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/edmonton.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-154" class="wp-caption-text">Edmonton Rush</figcaption></figure> 

**laxinoregon:** Rank 6 &#8211; Look it&#8217;s good to have 3 wins, two against Colorado, but until the consistently do something they&#8217;re going to sit at the bottom spot.  
**zymstere:** Rank 5 &#8211;Â  Edmonton has all the pieces in place to be a contender, they just need the confidence that they can compete.  
**RP=BA:** Rank 6 &#8211; Hamley will trade half his roster at the deadline so its tough to get a beat on them. Lots of individual talent but crummy goaltending, below avg D, and the worst tranny unit in the West will bury them.  
**Zeboim:** Rank 4 &#8211; Edmonton seems like they should be winning more games. I think the problem may be that some of the Rush players don&#8217;t seem to be playing the whole game. Hamley is probably the most successful coach in the NLL in the post-season, so don&#8217;t count him out of the hunt.  
 **StealthDragon:** Rank 5 &#8211; Win or lose I think it&#8217;s safe to say that Hamley is still trying to trade someone. I don&#8217;t quite like all the pieces he has in place, but maybe he does for all I know. But if I had to guess, until Dan Dawson is on his roster again I&#8217;d say Hamley is still looking for pieces to the puzzle he built in Arizona.

**Minnesota Rank: 5.6**<figure id="attachment_144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144" style="width: 100px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-144" title="minnesota" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minnesota.gif" alt="Minnesota Swarm" width="100" height="100" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minnesota.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-144" class="wp-caption-text">Minnesota Swarm</figcaption></figure> 

**laxinoregon:** The West isn&#8217;t what you thought it was and your Eastern foes aren&#8217;t laying down either. Offense needs help and 2 good defenders does not make a good defense.  
**zymstere:** Minneapolis is in total disarray. They trade their leader in scoring 2008 (Craig Point) and Cousins has been mediocre. Croswell & Patterson has been solid in net to start the season but the O has not been able to lay the hammer down.  
**RP=BA:** They fend off the Rush, but BARELY. This team is in a bad way, Patterson isn&#8217;t the same he was last year, the transition game has struggled and an offense built around other guys contributing aren&#8217;t getting the contributions they needed. I hated the Point trade for them too, that was dumb to give him up, he&#8217;s gonna blow up in Rochester.  
 **Zeboim:** Minnesota lacks a &#8220;team&#8221; identity. That by itself wouldn&#8217;t put you at the bottom of my list, but five straight losses puts you at the bottom of the list.  
**StealthDragon:** My how the mighty have fallen! First to worst in just 5 straight losses. Traded away last seasons&#8217; Rookie of the Year Craig Point.

That is all for now.Â  I&#8217;ll work up another round of rankings at the end of March heading in to the playoffs.Â  Put your comments below and let us know what you think too.
