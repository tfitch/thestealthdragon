After Sean Morris&#8217;s two goals and two assists pro debut and little bit of recognition was in order and it came from the league giving him the Rookie of the Week award.

[NLL Week 13 Awards](http://www.nll.com/article.php?id=3395)

I doubt Morris gets a trophy or even a plaque for his effort but I feel lucky I was able to see. He can mature in to a great lefty in the league and I&#8217;ll be able to say &#8220;I was there when it started.&#8221;. He was lightning quick and the Roughneck defenders were totally unprepared to be playing against him. It was a great little bit of coaching by Walt Christianson to put Morris in the lineup and shake things up from the previous two meetings between the teams.

Also winning an award this week in a performance I saw in person was Brian Langtry getting Offensive Player of the week for his nine(!!!) goals and four assist game at Portland. During the game it didn&#8217;t seem like a particularly impressive offensive outburst by Tree because it was spread out through the whole game. But once the game was over an old acquaintance came up from the field and told us how many points he&#8217;d actually scored and we were amazed. Good effort Tree &#8211; get it all out of your system before that regular season ending game in San Jose.
