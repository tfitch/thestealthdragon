Time to potentially lock up our play off spot, maybe even 3rd place.

Edmonton&#8217;s coming to town after battling in Calgary last night. There trip was longer than ours today, so hopefully that&#8217;s to our advantage.

The Rush are really hungry for a win to fight for a playoff spot. But so are we, and we&#8217;re at home and we&#8217;ve beaten these guys twice already. We&#8217;re one of the few teams that have even beaten them at their own place this year. We&#8217;ve got their number and we&#8217;re going to ring it up tonight.

Compared to how tough Portland matches up with us and plays us, Edmonton is a smaller team where we can assert ourselves and control things. After last nights match, we&#8217;ll all be looking forward to it.

Curtis Palidwor will be motivated to make up for the last game were he let in 14, about 4 more than his average. But I think we can do it again.

It&#8217;s a Saturday game instead of a Sunday game, so the attendance numbers will be up from the last time. A little louder and prouder fans to urge the Stealth forward.

We&#8217;ll win about 13-8 tonight I figure. Everyone will be able to take a sigh of relief that we&#8217;ve achieved the team goal for the season to make the playoffs. Next week we can work on work on some playoff strategy against the might Colorado Mammoth. Good times.
