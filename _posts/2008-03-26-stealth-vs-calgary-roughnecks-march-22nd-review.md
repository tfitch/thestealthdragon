Score 4. Give up a 12-5 run. Score 4. And you&#8217;ve got victory for the first place Stealth over the visiting Calgary Roughnecks.

The Roughnecks were really missing the TKO (Tracy Kelusky Offense) with TK&#8217;s return to the Injured Reserve list after playing the last two games. Steve Dietrich returned to the lineup but did not play despite Pat Campbell&#8217;s rocky start giving the Stealth a 6-1 lead part way in the second quarter.

Top to bottom every single member of the Stealth contributed on Saturday. So everyone is going to get recognition this week.

2) Paul Dawson &#8211; the tough guy stood up for everyone, especially little Wick when he took out Jeff Moleski at the knees.  
2) Tim Booth &#8211; helped tie up the final faceoff with 4.4 seconds left to preserve the victory.  
5) Frank Resetarits &#8211; the big guy scored one and helped clear the paths for Wick and Wiles.  
6) Curtis Hodgson &#8211; beat up Scott Ranger and got the crowd in to it.  
7) Colin Doyle &#8211; quarterbacked the offense and scored the sweet game winning goal with 4.4 seconds left.  
9) Jeff Zywicki &#8211; Mr. Consistency with another 3 goals including his league leading 6th short handed goal and his 100th NLL goal.  
10) Sean Morris &#8211; welcome to the NLL. Never played a box game before so he went for 2 goals and 2 assists. Bravo.  
11) Kyle Sorenson &#8211; drew multiple penalties from Roughneck players taking shots at him, but kept his cool each time.  
15) Luke Wiles &#8211; 2 goals and 5 assists. Scored that big goal to tie it at 12 with 5 minutes to go.  
20) Shaydon Shantos &#8211; zeros across the box score and 2 loosies. The perfect Shaydon game, because he anchors the defense. Especially on Man Down when he makes the crucial slides.  
21) Steve Holmes &#8211; Did great in transition pushing the ball up the floor and pressuring the &#8216;Necks to get out on the field.  
25) Eric Martin &#8211; The Stealth loose ball leader lead the way again. We&#8217;ll miss you next weekend in Edmonton.  
29) Cam Sedgwick &#8211; 1 and 4 for Cam on Saturday. He got 3 of his assists on the last three goals in the comeback.  
34) Luke Hinton &#8211; He doesn&#8217;t get to play every game, but his hustle to get out the door and shutdown the &#8216;Necks transition that torched us in the last meeting is greatly appreciated.  
41) Zach Heffner &#8211; I would pick him as being an American player. He&#8217;s as physical as any Canadian and gets the crowd in to the game.  
44) Anthony Cosmo &#8211; Played a great game and knew when to cut his losses and get Bold on the floor to finish the job. It&#8217;s always rough to see him leave the floor.  
55) Steve Panarelli &#8211; He&#8217;s a little energizer bunny, scooping up loose balls and always going full speed every moment he&#8217;s on the floor.  
77) Aaron Bold &#8211; the kid comes in to close the door and only let in 2 goals in the final 22 minutes of game play.

Thanks to each and every one of you guys above for making our trip down to San Jose so great. You&#8217;re a solid group of players and no change is necessary for you win The Championship Cup this season. Just keep playing exactly like you&#8217;re playing and ride it all the way through May!

**Game MVP:**  
Without a doubt, the captain Colin Doyle with 4 goals and 5 assists. He dominated the game just like I thought he would after the two assist performance against Philly.
