What&#8217;s better than getting to watch one Stealth practice after a six month off season?  Watching two Stealth practices!

Not much to report tonight.  Everyone who was playing this morning was playing this evening.  A quick chat with new <a href="http://www.stealthlax.com/team/front-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GM Doug Locker</a> tells us that all the players not in camp today are planning on playing, they&#8217;re just working out their various contracts.  I am confidently looking forward to watching these players in <a href="http://www.stealthlax.com/gameday/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the upcoming 2010 season</a>.

Here are a few photos from this evening.  I&#8217;ve got some videos too, but didn&#8217;t bring the all hardware to work with them.  Look for those to go up later.
