Stealth GM Johnny Mouradian doesn&#8217;t even come up to Paul Rabil&#8217;s chin.<figure id="attachment_91" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91" style="width: 286px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

Watch out everyone, the sky&#8217;s the limit for Rabil.

In other Stealth news a few players have signed their contracts for the year.  Second year goalie Tyler &#8220;The Ghost&#8221; Richards is coming back to San Jose this winter and rookie forward Rhys Duch has also signed his contract.  Since some airline opened up a direct flight from Victoria to SF this summer it should be a pretty easy commute for him to make his trips.
