How many other pro sports have players be a part of every practice only dress once in a two months span and then have that same player come out and score 3 goals with 2 assists in a one and done playoff game?  I&#8217;m guessing zero.

I&#8217;ve [personally said](http://thestealthdragon.com/eighteen/) that Frank needed to stay on the bench because he had not been producing and I appreciate Frank proving me wrong.  Resetarits rested up during the regular season and really took it to the Lumberjax on Friday night.

So here&#8217;s to Frank Resetarits!  In my opinion, he defines the ultimate &#8220;team player&#8221; after this effort.
