**When:** Saturday January 31st 2009

**Where:** All points on the HP Pavillion turf

**How to Enter:** Be Edmonton&#8217;s best defender

**Previous Winner:** Jeff Moleski of Calgary

**Expectations:** You&#8217;ll be attached to Colin&#8217;s hip at all moments throughout the evening.  Colin won&#8217;t put out, but he will put up points on you.

Double date opportunities exist with Jeff Zywicki and his defender.

**Note:** The more attention you pay to Colin the greater the risk everyone else is scoring behind you.  Good luck with that.
