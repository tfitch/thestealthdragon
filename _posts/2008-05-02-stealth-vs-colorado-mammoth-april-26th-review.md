West Division Champs!

Say hello to your 2008 NLL Regular Season West Division Champion San Jose Stealth!

The Colorado Mammoth and great collection of their fans came out West for an old fashioned ass whooping in a very important game. There are two things I took from the game.

  1. You want Colin Doyle on your team when the game is important.
  2. You don&#8217;t want Dan Carey and Josh Sims on the injured list when you can&#8217;t win w/o them

Outside of the game, is the total constant in the second half of the season is Mr. Cosmo in goal. Gavin Prout failed to assist any of the Mammoth in scoring a goal in the final 25 minutes of game play! When was the last time the Mammoth were shut out for 25 minutes? (Probably the Black Out game in Colorado, hehe).

The game wasn&#8217;t all roses though. The Stealth highlights were consolidated to the first and fourth quarters. The Stealth actually lost the second and third quarters by a combined score of 4 to 2. Against a better team this lull could lead to a loss, so I am worried about that. But it&#8217;s the playoffs now and our whole team has the experience from going to the Western Finals last year. The Stealth will take the momentum from this regular season ending victory and make their Champions Cup run.

Good job Stealth!
