After <a href="http://thestealthdragon.com/hey-rabil-huntley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what I said</a> when Paul Rabil and Kevin Huntley were not signed to contracts I feel obligated to follow up on the situation and say

&#8220;HEY HUNTLEY!  Please sign your contract and get your ass to practice!&#8221;  You get paid to pay lacrosse.  Where&#8217;s the issue?  Do you know how much the average lax player like myself has shelled out over my life so that I could play?  Driving, flying, hotels, gear.  When was the last time you paid for a stick?  You&#8217;re creating problems where there aren&#8217;t any.  Please come to San Jose and kick start your indoor career.

As for Paul Rabil, Mr. Inside Lacrosse Player of the Year, welcome welcome welcome!  The Stealth roster has you listed as a transition player and that&#8217;s got me excited.  You&#8217;re one big, fast dude.  I can&#8217;t wait to see you clear the zone and bring the ball up the floor before the other team even has someone out the back door or the goalie realizes you snipe corners with either hand as you run at them.  If you grow in to a player like Mark Steenhuis it&#8217;ll be good times in San Jose.  See you on the 9th!
