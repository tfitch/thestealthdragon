As [I predicted on Saturday](http://thestealthdragon.com/round-1-stealth-vs-lumberjax-point-stealth/) after watching the game, Rosy was awarded the Overall AND Offensive Player of the Week awards for his performance against the Lumberjax. Grats to Rosy.

As a side note, the kid shooter Ryan Benesch was awarded Rookie of the Week for his to game, actually both losses. He single handedly kept Toronto in the game against Colorado which went to overtime. He&#8217;s playing good, well worth his #1 overall selection value. And I&#8217;m glad we were able to get Colin Doyle for him, Fines and Thompson. We&#8217;re actually doing better than Toronto right now. So we got a good deal and Toronto will get a good deal. They&#8217;ve traded away several players this year, they went quickly from an aging team to a promising young team. They look like the Stealth did last year and even the year before when we traded away Josh Sanderson, Steve Toll and Curt Malawsky (let alone this year&#8217;s trades or losses of Cam Woods, Jim Moss, Derek Malawsky and Brendan Miller). They&#8217;ll get back on top someday since they can get all their players that live locally to more easily mesh through activities during the season. For now they&#8217;re setting up the architecture.
