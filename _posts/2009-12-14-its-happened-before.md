Cam Woods did it first, followed by <a href="http://www.thestealthdragon.com/?p=84" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Cosmo</a>.  Now Colin Doyle joins the list of star Stealth players that returned East because they have a life outside of lacrosse and lacrosse doesn&#8217;t pay the bills.  I&#8217;m kind of glad that they did because I can finally stop worrying about when this will happen.  The players and the fans can move on and great ready for the season.

Ted Jenner again breaks the news coming out of the West.  <a href="http://www.nllinsider.com/2009/12/14/breaking-colin-doyle-swapped-for-lewis-ratcliff-tyler-codron-and-joel-dalgarno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Doyle traded back to Toronto</a>.

The full deal is Colin Doyle and a conditional 2nd round pick in the 2012 draft to Toronto for Lewis Ratcliff, Tyler Codron and Joel Dalgarno.  The condition is if Tyler Codron plays at least 7 games this season after returning from his knee injury then the draft pick kicks in.  If Codron can&#8217;t return this season then it is just all three for Doyle.

My initial thought is that Toronto paid a great deal to get Doyle back.  I mean, he&#8217;s one great player traded for 3 good, even All Star level, players.  I&#8217;m not positive that the Rock are necessarily better because of this trade.  I&#8217;m going to think about it a little more.  There&#8217;s a big void in the Stealth locker room and offense right now.
