&#8230; in Victoria.

As reported by Ted Jenner <a href="http://www.nllinsider.com/2009/12/11/shamrocks-look-to-past-for-future-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over on NLL Insider</a>, along with <a href="http://www.victoriashamrocks.ca/news.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Victoria Shamrocks website</a>, Coach Walt Christianson is back as head coach with the Victoria Shamrocks of the WLA.  Coach Walt replaces long time Stealth defensive coordinator Art Webster as the coach in Victoria.  Nothing is mentioned on if Coach Art will stay on to assist Coach Walt as he has in the past.

Coach Walt is my favorite former Stealth head coach.  I liked him and the players seemed to like him.  He knows a lot about box lacrosse and how to coach it to the players.  It was a damn shame that he was fired after the 2008 season when the Stealth ran into a red hot Lumberjax team/Dan Dawson in the first round of the playoffs.

In time Coach Hall might take the &#8220;Favorite Stealth Coach&#8221; title away, but not yet.  Keep up the good work Coach Walt, but don&#8217;t return to the NLL.  I&#8217;d hate to play against your teams.
