I had a fun experience at the Portland Airport Friday morning. I ran in to Good Dog, Bad Dog to grab a napkin and at the condiments counter was a familiar face that I knew but had never met. Brian Langtry was getting an early lunch before catching his flight back to Denver for Saturday&#8217;s Stealth vs. Mammoth match up. Also with Tree was John Gallant. They were very nice to talk to which is very upsetting because it is easy to hate Tree on the floor because of his ability to score big goals against his opponent. But off the floor he was the nicest guy. He asked me my name and asked if I was from Denver (there had been a couple of Mammoth fans at the Portland game last night). I had my Stealth hat and shirt on and had to explain that while he was on his way home to his next game I was on my way to my own game in San Jose that night.

My favorite part of the quick discussion we had was that I told him that my wife and I had been at the big Stealth vs. Mammoth playoff game last year. I said it was the most amazing game ever. His simple analysis of the game was &#8220;It was a kick in the nuts.&#8221;

I wished them luck in the rest of the season except against the Stealth and I said we&#8217;d see them in the playoffs and headed to my gate.

Now I just wonder who we&#8217;ll see at the airport tomorrow morning when Calgary and San Jose are heading to their respective Saturday games.
