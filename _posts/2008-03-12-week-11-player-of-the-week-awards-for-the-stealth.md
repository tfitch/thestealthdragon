First off, I need to apologize to Aaron Bold and Jeff Zywicki for not taking the time to note their achievements earlier this season, but going to the games was eating all my spare time up and I&#8217;m home for a couple of week before and can throw out some proper recognition here.

First up Luke Wiles, Offensive Player of the Week for his 3 goals and 4 assists against the Mammoth last Saturday. Luke is the Stealth&#8217;s 3rd choice on offense, so after Colin Doyle and Jeff Zywicki draw the attention of top defenders Luke is left with some scrub to tear apart. Getting shots off also isn&#8217;t a problem for Luke, but he connected on all manner of shots this week on his way to earning this recognition.

Also rewarded for his effort is the recently surging Frank Resetarits, the Rookie of the Week. Resetarits scored 3 goals, including two in just over 3 minutes against the Mammoth. Frank has scored 8 goals in the last 3 Stealth games and has finally found his place in the fast paced, hard hitting NLL game. Welcome to the league Frank, keep up the good work.
