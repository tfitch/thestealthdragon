I found a song today named Dear Chicago by Ryan Adams. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ryan+Adams/_/Dear+Chicago" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can listen to it here.</a>

I thought I&#8217;d bastardize the lyrics since I&#8217;ve got nothing much else to do right now. Amazingly there were several phrases I didn&#8217;t even have to make any changes to (and yes, that&#8217;s partly because I&#8217;m lazy).

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

Dear Chicago,  
You&#8217;ll never guess.  
You know the trade pick you said I&#8217;d get someday?  
Well, I&#8217;ve got something to confess.

You dropped from the league on a Friday.  
Never asked me if for anything from you.  
I just laughed and couldn&#8217;t believe it,  
Said &#8220;that&#8217;s impossible to do.&#8221;

My life&#8217;s gotten simple since.  
And it fluctuates so much.  
Happy and sad and back again.  
I&#8217;m not crying out to much.

Think about you all the time.  
It&#8217;s strange and hard to deal.  
Think about you lying there.  
And the arena lies so still.

Nothing breathes here in the cold.  
Nothing moves or even smiles.  
I&#8217;ve been thinking some of Cosmo.

But there&#8217;s bars out here for miles.  
Sorry about the draft pick.  
Every fan you wasted.

I thought the thing you said was true,  
We&#8217;d get a draft pick in &#8217;09 from you.

The wind&#8217;s feeling real these days.  
Yeah, baby, it hurt&#8217;s me some.  
Never thought I&#8217;d feel so blue.  
New York City, you&#8217;re almost gone.  
I think that I&#8217;ve fallen out of love,  
I think I&#8217;ve fallen out of love . . . with you

&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

I know the remaining pick from the Cosmo trade will be awarded to the team by the league, so it&#8217;s not lost. But IIRC from the Sting going tits up the pick was awarded at the end of the round it was due. And for a first round pick that&#8217;s a large change. If Chicago had finished middle of the pack the pick goes from maybe 5th to 13th. That&#8217;s just the way it is, but I wanted to say something about it.

Finally, I won&#8217;t miss your name. Your X was horrible and you were an embarrassment to the real Shamrocks. And my feelings for the X apply to Portland too, but they managed to put in the logo so well I kinda forgive them.
