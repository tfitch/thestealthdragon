In the final match up of the season the Stealth headed in to Portland.

It was the hardest fought match up of the series. We pulled out to a comfortable lead, 7-1 early in the 3rd, same as in Arizona. Then we let the Jax take the lead, same as in Arizona. This time around though, we fought back after we went down 8-7 to pull out the victory 9-8. Different than in Arizona, I think we learned something in that game.

Tensions were high through out, but no actual fights occurred. Rosy stayed away from Goonze, but was still a bit chippy. Shaydon got the only major penalty for a high stick when he almost took Holmon&#8217;s head off. During that penalty the Jax got a number of goals and was key is letting them back in.

Dallas Eliuk did a great job in the goal, making a huge number of saves. Which he had to do because we took a huge number of shots, a staple of the Portland defense.

On our end Cosmo only had 31 saves I think. I wish the Jax would have taken more shots and help him get his save percentage up higher ðŸ˜‰ But his goals against stayed low, and that&#8217;s the key stat.

I think Coach Keenan throwing the water bottle on the field when he objected to a refs call should have been more than a 2-min penalty. That was a really poor sport thing to do.

I&#8217;m glad we won, not too much else to say at this moment. More importantly, I&#8217;m getting ready for the Edmonton game now.

Stay classy Portland.
