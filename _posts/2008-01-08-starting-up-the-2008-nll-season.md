After being distraught for months on end after the San Jose Stealth lost to the Arizona Sting in the West Conference finals it is finally time to get back to writing as the 2008 season begins this weekend in Calgary.

The main reason I went dark after the end of the NLL season is because I moved up Eastern Oregon right after last season ended. The Internet out here is horrible compared to San Francisco, but that&#8217;s not really surprising is it? And I didn&#8217;t go to any of the SF Dragons games, so I didn&#8217;t get in to the MLL season like I did in the summer of &#8217;06.

In order to now get to the Stealth games I&#8217;ll be going through Portland to get to the airport to fly to SJC. And since we have to go to Portland we picked up Lumberjax tickets as well so I can attend the games with my old lax teammates from college. The schedule works out almost perfectly, there is only one conflict where both the Stealth and Lumberjax have home games the same night. (Early April when the Stealth host Edmonton and the Lumberjax host Phlly, and considering the cost of the trip to SJ for a weekend, we&#8217;ll skip that one game in order to see Matt Roik, Taylor Wray and Geoff Snider play instead of an Edmonton team we&#8217;ll have seen multiple times during the season).

In conclusion, I&#8217;ve maybe doubled my personal work load here. I&#8217;ll be writing up Portland games well as San Jose games, but probably just the Portland home games that I&#8217;ll be attending. And it all starts this week with the Stealth at Calgary and Lumberjax hosting the NY Titans. My previews of those games are coming up over the next couple days.
