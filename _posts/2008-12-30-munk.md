I wanna give a shout out to the new Stealth that I have the most in common with. Jonathan Munk who went to the same high school as I did in Oregon. We&#8217;ve only had lacrosse at our high school for 12 years now and we&#8217;ve already got our first pro. After playing last season with the Portland Lumberjax, but not actually getting off the practice roster, Munk returned to California this year to coach lacrosse at his alma mater Division 2 Notre Dame de Namur University in Belmont, CA (a small community on the peninsula between San Francisco and San Jose). Coaching in California makes it really hard to travel to PDX for the Jax games so the Stealth and Jax traded Munk&#8217;s rights on December 17th for a bag of balls, excuse me a 5th round &#8217;09 pick.

Good luck at your first practice this weekend!
