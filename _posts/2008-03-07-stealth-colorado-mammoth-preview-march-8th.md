Bring on the Black Out. After talking it up during the first two broadcasts of the year for the first Stealth visit of the year, this weekend it finally happens. The Mammoth get to wear black at home, the crowd wears black, the Stealth where their home whites and still beat the crap out of the Mammoth.

The first meeting had the Stealth still working out their roster since it was the first month of the season. Since then the Mammoth have lost their last two games and the Stealth have won three of four the the lone loss coming to the Minnesota Swarm to cap a four game in nine nights stretch where they were exhausted in the final five minutes.

The Stealth have had a light schedule with only one game in the past three weeks. The Mammoth have also been resting, after losing to the Calgary Roughnecks two weeks ago with three starters out due to injuries that night. Both teams should be rested and 100% healthy.

Offensively the Stealth need to change everything that they did during the last meeting in Denver. The offense needs to attach the cage instead of the passive, Portland/Edmonton like offense they displayed when scoring on 6 goals in January. Jeff Zywicki, Colin Doyle and Luke Wiles will be attacking the cage and burning Gee Nash with close in shots.

In transition the Stealth also need to change their tune from the first meeting and play just like have in their previous 4 games with hustle and grit. Working for ground balls together, getting off the floor so defenders can cut off the offensive transition opportunities the Mammoth consistently generate.

Anthony Cosmo is rounding in to his end of season form of last season. He&#8217;s used to the travel schedule again and is ready along with his Stealth defenders to shutdown the Mammoth.

Last weekend was the last weekend the Stealth have without a game until they bring home the Champions Cup. Every weekend they&#8217;ll have game including a couple of double headers. This continuity in the schedule will be great for the Stealth as they&#8217;ll be on a regular schedule of games every week. The team will gel in all aspects, starting with the win against the Mammoth that ties the Stealth for first place.

**Prediction:**  
Stealth 13 &#8211; Mammoth 11 in another epic battle that&#8217;ll leave a sour taste in the mouth of Mammoth fans.
