I spent the entire day yesterday mourning the trade of [Anthony Cosmo](http://www.nll.com/community/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=userProfile&user=1051331%26seasonid=1995) from the [San Jose Stealth](http://www.sjstealth.com/index2.html) to the [Chicago Shamrox](http://www.chicagoshamrox.com/home.html). (See the article [SAN JOSE DEALS COSMO TO CHICAGO](http://nll.com/article.php?id=3580).)  I am almost too sad to write about the trade even today. 

My hubby keeps trying to rationalize the trade and all I have to say to him is that I am not ready to hear it.  I know [Aaron Bold](http://www.nll.com/community/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=userProfile&user=668201%26seasonid=1995) is great in cage, that [Tyler Richards](http://www.nll.com/community/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=userProfile&user=1484391%26seasonid=1995) is having an awesome summer, and that [Matt Roik](http://www.nll.com/community/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=userProfile&user=398877%26seasonid=1995) isn&#8217;t half bad himself.  But with Cosmo you not only get more than solid goal tending, you also get the intangibles, such as knowing when to take a Canadian timeout.

Right now I am just sad I won&#8217;t see my Cos. Cosmo, if you are reading this, I wish you the very best of luck in Chicago.
