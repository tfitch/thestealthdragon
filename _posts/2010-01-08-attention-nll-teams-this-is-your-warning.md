The Stealth have a player on the team that fans may not recognize from last season.

After watching him last season and now in training camp heading in to this season he looks like a completely different player.  Not just an improved player, but a different player.  So watch out.

The Colorado Mammoth will find out first during the Stealth home opener.  Watch the game Saturday to see who I&#8217;m talking about and then come back here Sunday when I fill in the picture.

**Ding! Ding! Ding!**

Brian is the winner!  You&#8217;ve just won, ummm, the privilege of hanging out last night?!

Paul Rabil did not disappoint in his season debut.  Two goals and three assists against the Mammoth in the Stealth 17-8 win was a great outting and a career high single game point total in the NLL for Rabil.  Rabil didn&#8217;t take it to the cage yet like he has in practice, but he still produced five points and did his role.

Keep up the great work Rabes.
