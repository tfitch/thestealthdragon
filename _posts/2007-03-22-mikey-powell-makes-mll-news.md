Looks like Mikey Powell is going to return to the MLL this summer.

<a href="http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=482" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikey Powell traded to Boston for Connor Gill</a>

Wowzer, this is a heck of a trade. Not quite as big a trade as the one before the start of the season last year that moved all the marquee players West, but still pretty big. Connor Gill is a former league MVP. Mikey Powell has only played one out of the three years he&#8217;s been eligible for the league. And the one year he did play he was surrounded my so much talent, they didn&#8217;t even need him and the points he produced. So Mikey is an unproven commodity, with lots of potential.

This still shows that the players in the league have some say in how things go. Connor lives in Baltimore, Mikey is working for Brine which is HQ&#8217;d in Boston. So it was a good fix to for both guys to not have to commute to home games. If these guys made a living wage playing the game they&#8217;d live where they played and these trades wouldn&#8217;t happen, but for now it makes the off season roster moves exciting. The best players in the world are all still out playing in the league, even if they aren&#8217;t making a living wage, so it&#8217;s not that bad of a deal for the fans. Just don&#8217;t get too attached to your favorite player unless you know he lives in the area and has got a solid foundation so that he probably won&#8217;t move or be traded. At that point you can safely buy his jersey and cheer cheer cheer.

Now&#8230; where will Casey end up? Back out at Rochester still?
