In both the NLL and the NFL, Reebok is the official equipment sponsor.  Like the NLL the NFL requires players to wear Reebok gear, but in the NFL if a player has an endorsement deal with Nike then the player can wear Nike shoes.  Currently, the NLL players must use all Reebok gear all the time.

I was thinking about <a href="http://www.rabilslacrosse.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Rabil</a>, as well as <a href="http://rhinolacrosse.com/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Powell</a>.  They have endorsement contracts with Under Armour and Nike respectively, but they are required to go out on the floor wearing clunky Reebok shoes when they are paid to represent much better gear.  Heck, even Reebok socks are pitiful compared to the Nike and Under Armour offerings.  I don&#8217;t know what you wear, but I love my [Nike Dri-Fit socks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZEB062?ie=UTF8&tag=tylfit-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002ZEB062).

Does anyone know why the NFL players can wear their own endorsed gear but the NLL players cannot? I am guessing it comes down to dollars and cents in Reebok&#8217;s contract with the NLL.  But I cannot believe anyone watching NLL players thinks the players are successful because of their Reebok \*shoes\*.  I guess the inverse argument to that is the players also are n0t successful because of their Nike or Under Armour shoes.

I imagine that an exception for shoes would then lead to players wanting an exception for sticks and gloves.  This equipment does matter to the players, but also matters to Reebok as Reebok is getting into the sticks and gloves market and having all the NLL players using Reebok sticks and gloves showcases their products.

For me, the real issue here is that this is an opportunity for the players to make a little extra money with some endorsement deals.  They make so little money actually playing lacrosse that it is a shame more endorsement opportunities do not exist for them while they are playing.  These are professional athletes, they can and should be getting endorsement deals!
