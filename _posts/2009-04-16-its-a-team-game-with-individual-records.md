Here&#8217;s my opinion on the subject.  The Stealth have locked up their position in the playoffs, no matter what happens in Toronto, the Stealth are playing in Portland the first round of the playoffs.  So the players can find motivation this weekend in going out and rewarding the player that got them there, their captain Colin Doyle.  Without the Doylermaker the Stealth may not have gone to the playoffs these past three seasons.  Now the team can reward him for his efforts by getting him the scoring record.  Colin is great, but a 10 goal game may not be in the cards, I think he&#8217;s still exhausted after the OT Colorado game last weekend.

This is also the Stealth&#8217;s first ever trip to Toronto and Colin&#8217;s first return to Toronto after playing on the Rock and winning five(!!!!!) NLL Championships with them.  The fans remember and miss him dearly, the opinion in <a href="http://wingszone.com/nllmb/showthread.php?t=43453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Wingszone forums</a> is that the fans will be cheering for Colin as much, or more than, the Rock.

Here&#8217;s my plan of attack for the offense.

  * If you just received a pass from Doyle you have the green light.  <span style="color: #008000;">SHOOT AND SCORE</span>.
  * If you just received a pass not from Doyle, but he made the previous pass, you have the green light.  <span style="color: #008000;">SHOOT AND SCORE</span>.
  * If you just received a pass and it nor the pass before it was from Doyle then pass it to Doyle.  <span style="color: #ff0000;">PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT AND SCORE*</span>.

That should do it. Three simple rules to play by.  Have a great game everyone.  I&#8217;m confident the Rock fans will love it every time Colin gets a goal or assist and cheer you guys on for more more more.

Good luck and thank you Colin!  Go Stealth Go!

* And yes this is a joke (but not entirely).  The Stealth would not be where they are right now without Doyle, I think this is a great opportunity for the team to give him this record as recognition of his leadership and contributions.
