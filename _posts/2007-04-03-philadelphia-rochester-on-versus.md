I watched the NLL Game of the Week last night.

Philadelphia went up to Rochester and did a good job of showing what a second tier team looks like when it plays a top tier team. Philly just didn&#8217;t look sharp, they consistently dropped passes on Man Up in the first half. And that directly corresponded to when Rochester pulled away. Matt Roik didn&#8217;t look like his All Star self from the first half of the season. He let in 6 I think before he was pulled in the second quarter.

Rochester on the other end capitalized on every opportunity early, jumping out to the lead and never looking back. Their offense is older and more mature than the Philly and it showed.

Steve Toll is really amazing. He picks so many passes out of the air, it&#8217;s almost incomprehensible. Think about it, he doesn&#8217;t just knock the pass out of the air, he only ever picks the pass out of the air. That means no matter where he pokes his stick at, he&#8217;s got the head open to the direction of the ball and picks it. It&#8217;s amazing, picks not knockdowns. It&#8217;s amazing to watch the guy, he probably picks four or more passes a game. He&#8217;s a pleasure to watch.

Rochester had the majority of the penalties and still won the game. I don&#8217;t know if that happens regularly as a stat, but the penalties slow them down.

The final score was 10-12 and I don&#8217;t think it was even that close. Philly never quit and kept trying to come back at the end, while Rochester appeared to be on cruise control just trying to get out of the game w/o incident. If it had gotten back to a one goal game, the Knighthawks would have put in a couple more as needed.

Next week is Philly again and the New York Titans, won&#8217;t be that interesting since it&#8217;ll be about the 5th or 6th time Philly will be the Game of the Week, but I get to watch Jarrett Park play for the Titans and that&#8217;ll be a good time.
