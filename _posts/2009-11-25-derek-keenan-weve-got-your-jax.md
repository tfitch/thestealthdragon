Dear Coach Keenan: 

I&#8217;ve noticed you&#8217;ve been reassembling several of your former Portland Lumberjax players up in Edmonton over the summer.

I&#8217;ve also noticed that there are a couple that you have not yet picked up.  Training camp is about 10 days away, time to get moving on this.

You just need to call up Johnny Mouradian and tell him that you want to give the Stealth Ian Hawksbee and you would like the Stealth will give you Peter Morgan and Brad MacDonald.  Morgan and MacDonald don&#8217;t suck and I really miss Hawks from when he played with the Stealth back in 2007.  This totally works in my mind.

Do it!  Do it now!!!

Thanks for your time,

Tyler
