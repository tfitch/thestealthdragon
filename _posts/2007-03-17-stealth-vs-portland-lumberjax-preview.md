Finally, another home game after about a month away from home. The First home game since I started this site up. The first home game for Andrew Burkholder as well.

We&#8217;ve got Portland coming to town and they&#8217;re pissed. They&#8217;ve lost 8 in a row, their best player is injured and not guaranteed to play, and their goalie is 46 years old. Welcome Portland.

This is going to be short and sweet. I&#8217;ve been writing the All Star game reviews all day and gotta leave for San Jose in 10 mins. So here&#8217;s the bullet points.

1) Portland needs Brodie Merril to play or they&#8217;ll lose.  
2) Cosmo needs to keep up the momentum he&#8217;s had in the last two games.  
3) Portland&#8217;s offense needs to appear. If you lose 8 in a row it&#8217;s not your defense losing it for you. You&#8217;re not scoring points.  
4) Coach Keenan from Portland needs to shave his head. He&#8217;s a mean SOB when he&#8217;s bald, red faced (headed) and screaming at you. This year his hair (and lack their of is funny, not scary). Last year we got up on Portland 6-1 or 7-1 to start the game in Portland. Portland called a TO and he was reading the Jax the riot act. I was scared of Keenan during that speech and I wasn&#8217;t even in the same state. He doesn&#8217;t have that same mean look this year. Which is good for the Lumberjax opponents.

That&#8217;s about it. We play them tonight at home and next week in PDX. So I&#8217;ll concentrate on the review of tonight&#8217;s game and preview of next week&#8217;s when I&#8217;ve got more time ðŸ™‚
