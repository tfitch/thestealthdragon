Hi, it’s Zeboim here, helping StealthDragon write up this week’s games. Hope you all enjoy&#8230;

The Portland Lumberjax were the single biggest winner in the dispersal draft for the 2008 season. Picking up Dan Dawson and Derek Malawsky, both from the Arizona Sting, gives the Jax a much needed boost to their otherwise anemic offense. In the Jax home opener they managed only eleven points in total offense, nine of which involved Dawson. While Dawson has a reputation as a “Mammoth Killer” I am not convinced that his supporting staff will be enough to pull out a win over the high powered Colorado Mammoth offense.

The Mammoth has so many stars on offense they are virtually unstoppable. Gavin Prout leads the Mammoth offense in assists so look for him to set his teammates up in Portland. Jamie Shewchuk and Jason Wulder are wily near the crease. Brian Langtry is always good for a few points, but he also takes more shots than anyone else on the team. Do watch for Dan Carey, one of the most accurate shooters in the game and leading Mammoth point scorer, to squeak in a few tight goals. Josh Sims provides a boost to the Mammoth with a transition goal or two each game.

The Mammoth defense plays great team ball. They are really aggressive going after loose balls and have a talent for getting turnovers into their transition game quickly. Of course, the defense is greatly helped by having Gee Nash/Chris Levis in goal. Both goalies have great vision so Portland will need to move the ball around to have a shot at getting goals.

The Portland Lumberjax allowed fourteen goals in their first game. While this is a respectable goals against, they would have allowed even less had Dallas Eliuk been on form in the first quarter. Luckily, Matt King came in and made save after save. I don’t know which goalie will start Thursday night against the Mammoth, but whomever it is had better be on their game from the first whistle. The Jax defense is anchored by Brodie Merrill who will be all over loose balls. The rest of the defense should play solid, but will pay for any mistakes, i.e. penalties, slow slides.

I expect the game to be full of quick action and hard hits. While Portland will put up a valiant effort, **Colorado will win 15 to 11**.
