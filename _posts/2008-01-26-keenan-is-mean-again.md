Right before the Lumberjax players took the field a camera from the locker room showed the final pep talk to the team and there was coach Derek Keenan with a shaved head! I instantly turned to my old goalie and told him &#8220;You&#8217;re going to win! Keenan shaved his head and is mean. You&#8217;re going to win!&#8221;. He was slightly skeptical, but the team&#8217;s actions on the floor were a total reversal from the first game against the Titans. Had the Lumberjax played with the intensity of Thursday game against the New York Titans it would have been a win for the Jax.

Keenan did just as I said he should do last year and before the first game this year. Keenan has shaved his head again and is back to looking mean and scaring his players in to performing at the top of their game. Taking the Mammoth to OT is a great start with a 14 games still to be played.

A scary Derek Keenan is good for Portland lacrosse. Keep it up coach Keenan. Watch out for the Lumberjax now.
