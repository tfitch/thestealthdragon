While we were in Boston we were able to attend the Stealth practice on Friday night and I took some videos with my new mini camcorder. I&#8217;m not trying to go in reverse order, but the first two here are from the end of practice when Paul Rabil and Eric Martin took the time to do some extra shooting. It helped Rabil during the weekend but didn&#8217;t appear to help Meat that much. So here they are.

  
  
  
And in case your interested in the camera I used, it&#8217;s a Kodak Zi6. It&#8217;s a little bigger than an iPod but shoots HD video at up to 60 frames per second which is helpful when trying to track a lacrosse shot. The video quality isn&#8217;t like watching a movie and it has very little zoom, but it&#8217;s easy to carry around and easier to use. If you&#8217;re in the market for a camcorder check it out, it is only about $150.
