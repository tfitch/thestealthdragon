The rubber match of the season series has a whole lot of value riding on it. The winner is the West Division regular season champion and secures home field for the expected rematch the weekend of May 10th. I&#8217;ve already been to Denver and I prefer my seats in San Jose, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to the Stealth winning this matchup.

The Stealth have won 3 of the last 4 meetings of these teams. That is the biggest thing to the Stealth&#8217;s advantage, they have little to no fear of the Mammoth. One concern I have is that the Mammoth were able to beat up the Edmonton Rush last weekend and now have a small winning streak started. On the other end the Stealth last to Portland last and have been alternating wins and losses for over two months. So they shouldn&#8217;t lose a second game in a row, especially with Colin Doyle leading the way. He refuses to allow these guys to drop to in a row, he&#8217;ll do it all himself if that is what&#8217;s required.

That&#8217;s about all their is to say. There&#8217;s a whole lot riding on the game, luckily the Stealth have been at home for about a month straight and are in a nice set routine. Plus the Stealth are used to playing Noon game while the Mammoth don&#8217;t have the scheduling issues the Stealth do and won&#8217;t be used to such an early roll call.

**Prediction:**  
Stealth 14 &#8211; Mammoth 8

Go Stealth!
