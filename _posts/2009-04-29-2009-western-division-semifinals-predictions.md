I&#8217;ve gathered together my super squad of West Division friends and foes to give me their playoff predictions.  Without further ado, here are the predictions from <a href="http://wingszone.com/nllmb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wingszone forums members</a> and Lumberjax fans laxinoregon and Smackem, Mammoth fan Mtn_Scott and Stealth fans Zmystere, Zeboim and myself.  I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t included anyone from Calgary, but I haven&#8217;t really interacted or met with any of them yet.

**Laxinoregon:**  
Colorado @ Calgary. The 1 vs 4 seed. The #1 hasn&#8217;t faired in recent years, however, I expect Calgary to buck that trend with a landslide win, 15-9. Calgary&#8217;s offense is clicking and everyone&#8217;s healthy, defense is aggressive and plays within itself harrassing the opponents scorers. Only weakness is in the transition which unfortunately for Colorado they aren&#8217;t suited for. The only way at an upset will be if both Prout and Langtry score early and score often, I don&#8217;t see that happening.

San Jose @ Portland. The 2 vs 3 seed. San Jose has a few things going for them in this game. Renewed aggression on the defensive end, pay back for last years home playoff loss, and two guys by the name of Doyle and Zwyicki. Portland counters the dynamic duo of Batman and Robin with The Butcher (Alexander) and The Playboy (Codron) and The Wall (Disher). These two teams hate each other, plain and simple and I expect nothing less than a war on the floor, a few fights, a few lead changes, a penalty shot to send the game into overtime, and a Jax victory 12-11 in said OT. Or it could be a masacre of epic porpotions with a 17-9 San Jose win, but nah, my first predicition has more drama. Jax 12-11.

**Smackem:**  
I hope my Homer instincts don&#8217;t kick in too quickly so I&#8217;ll start with Colorado vs. Calgary. As much as this one seems to be a lock for Calgary I would offer some caution. If Leyshawn gets some early stops and builds his confidence he could keep Colorado around, but I&#8217;m doubtful that will happen with the injuries the Mammoth defense has suffered. Guze was a nice story of giving his all, but his 15 minutes of fame is over. No way anyone knows better than a Jax fan how much Langtry seems to rise to the occasions of away games, but it will be too little too late. Should Colorado get it going early I think Calgary will make a quick switch of goalies. Campbell and King have both played well and I believe either one could step in and stop the bleeding. Calgary puts this one away early, but I&#8217;m holding out hope for the Mammoth (homerism demands it).

Portland vs San Jose. This one is keeping me up at night. These 2 teams met 3 times and the Jax won twice. The problem I&#8217;m having is that Eric Martin absolutely handed one of those games over by taking horrible penalties at terrible times. I believe Peter Morgan has to play great and Disher has to be healthy enough to go the distance for the Jax to win. The Stealth seem to be getting it together and gaining momentum at just the right time. The question will be how do their rookies, particularly Duch, handle playoff pressure. I&#8217;d love to see the Jax quicken the pace on transition and see if it forces some rookie mistakes (this is where Rabil&#8217;s lack of box experience could hurt). What frightens me the most about the Stealth is undoubtedly Colin Doyle! I&#8217;m not sure if there is any one player out there I&#8217;d rather have than Doyle if you needed someone to will you to a win, he can flat out get it done. I know Dawson is incredible in the playoffs, but the Jax were just 6-10 with Dan. For an entire season I actually think I&#8217;d go with Doyle. OK, homer time. The Jax defense with Disher behind them can make any offensive players&#8217; life miserable. If the refs let them play physical, and I think in playoff atmosphere with the home crowd they will, the Jax are going to escape with a hard fought narrow victory.

**Zeboim:**  
Calgary vs Colorado &#8212; winner Calgary

Calgary is really hot right now. The entire team is playing like they want to win. The Roughnecks offense is really clicking. On defense, Calgary is swarming to the ball. Seriously, this team is playing so well that I expect them to represent the west in the Championship Cup this year.

This Colorado team is not the same as we have seen in past years. They have many injuries, resulting in no continuity on the floor on defense or offense. Also, they are playing uninspired lacrosse right now. The Mammoth seem to regret having Gavin Prout as their captain. He provides no leadership and has been a very selfish player this year.

Portland vs San Jose &#8212; winner Portland (come on Colin, prove me wrong!)

The Portland Lumberjax team identity revolves around their defense. The Jax defenders are big, strong, and fast. Tyler Codron is a shutdown defender who is extremely competitive and takes it as a personal challenge to stop whatever player the coach puts him on. Disher has been playing excellently this season, but I don&#8217;t know if he will be back at 100% for this game. Offensively, the Jax lack the firepower and leadership that Dan Dawson provided them with last year, but they manage to get enough transition goals from players like Brodie Merrill, Peter Morgan, and Scott Stewart.

San Jose has had a season that didn&#8217;t start off too strong. The team made a lot of changes from 2008, not all of them by choice. It is in games like these that the Stealth really miss Anthony Cosmo. The San Jose defense has improved with the addition of Shaydon Santos to the roster. Jeff Zywicki seems to be healed up, which will help out an already potent Stealth offense. Finally, and by no means least, Colin Doyle is an amazing team leader and he may just decide that I am full of crap and take this game into his own hands and lead the Stealth to a victory.

**Zymystere:**  
Portland is not necessarily better than last year, because they had a damn good team last year.  But they are now full of confidence and have trust in Disher to make the big saves to keep them in the game.

San Jose ended the season with big wins.The offence is what we had hoped they would be, though the scoring is coming from Duch and Doyle, versus last being Wick and Doyle. Wick is always dangerous in the second season, but it will come down to goal tenders. The Ghost T-Rich is hot and will take this time to solidify his position on the team. T-Rich will be the diff.

14 &#8211; 9 San Jose wins.

Now for the CO, they are a Jeckyl/Hyde team. If everyong plays their best game, they can do well. Prout will try to carry the team and Langtry will get 7 pts.

CAL is the class of the West.Thought that they would falter as the season went long, but they held together. Campbell should get the start and is a solid tender. TK is just being TK and Dobbie is a threat to keep the boys energized and open the shooting lanes.  
I see it being a close game, no more than a 1 goal differrential at the final whistle. Colorado will find a way to make up for a depleted D and sqeek out a win.

Colorado wins&#8230;barely!

**Mtn_Scott:**  
Colorado @ Calgary  
This is a very interesting game for quite a few reasons. On paper, this will be Calgary&#8217;s game to lose. Calgary&#8217;s offense and power play unit have been unstoppable all year. Fortunately for the Mammoth that plays directly into their strengths. Unfortunately, the Mammoth might start suiting up fans to play. In the final game of the season Rich Catton and Ray Guze both went down to injuries and status is uncertain. This adds to an already lengthy casualty list. The Mammoth&#8217;s best hope is the fact that this is a rivalry game, and games between these two teams always comes down to heart. I am not sure even a Mammoth size heart can overcome the pure talent differential. Calgary 12-8

San Jose @ Portland  
This is another game of a great offense versus a great defense. Normally, I would take the defense on this, but not when the offense involves Colin Doyle. He is the most clutch player in the league during the playoffs. Portland has beaten San Jose Twice this season already, beating them a third time will be tough in this league. San Jose 13-12 in OT.

**StealthDragon:**  
First up #4 Colorado @ #1 Calgary.  The previous two seasons the #4 seed in the West has walked in to the #1 seed&#8217;s barn and won.  In both of those games the #4 team had also beaten the #1 seed while playing at the #1 seed&#8217;s barn during the regular season.  This season Colorado beat Calgary 13-12 but it was not in Calgary.  I fully expect Calgary to break the curse of the #1 seed in the West losing in the first round.  Colorado has too many injuries on defense to stop Calgary&#8217;s offense and transition game.  Or Langtry scores 9 goals to keep it close, but Calgary still wins.

Now the big show #3 San Jose @ #2 Portland. The rematch of last season&#8217;s #4 over #1 upset in San Jose.  Most of the Stealth players were there last year and will have revenge on their mind.  The Stealth have defeated the Jax in Portland this year, so despite the season series being 2-1 in Portland&#8217;s favor this Stealth squad knows how to win in Portland.  Beating Portland goalie Matt Disher early and making him move will be key to the Stealth victory.  If Disher is hot then it could be a problem for the Stealth.  Jeff Zywicki is finally healthy and has been running around his defenders the past couple weeks after not driving to the cage and challenging defenders the first 3/4 of the season.  Brett Manney we&#8217;ll see you soon.  
My wild card factor is Portland coach Derek Keenan, there&#8217;s a 50/50 chance that he develops the right game plan for a Lumberjax victory.  When he plans right the Lumberjax can be dangerous.  Thankfully Stealth coach Chris Hall is capable of adjusting on the fly, so if the Jax get out of the gates fast there will still be time to right the Stealth ship.

In my opinion, it&#8217;s a good night and the Stealth win 13-8 like they did in late March.

**Final Tally:**

Calgary is picked 5 to 1 while the PDX/SJ meeting is split 3 picks each.  Bring on Friday!

**Go Stealth!**
