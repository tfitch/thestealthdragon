Damn, I&#8217;m getting way behind on my game reviews. But I&#8217;ve got thoughts about tomorrow&#8217;s lacrosse game between the Portland Lumberjax and the winless Edmonton Rush.

Normally on the third meeting of the season and second in two weeks I&#8217;d just point to the previous posting about this same match up. But this isn&#8217;t the same match up. Edmonton went out and got themselves a new coach and GM, Bob Hamley to take over for Paul Day.

Hamley inspired the team to a 4th quarter tie or lead against my might Stealth last weekend and that was on three days notice. Now Hamley&#8217;s had a whole week to prepare for the Jax and we might see a team that lives up to its potential to be the fourth best team in the West. The first step to this is beating a Portland team that has obtained loads of confidence by already beating Edmonton twice as well as Calgary.

Alas, Hamley is a great coach, but I don&#8217;t see the Rush beating the Jax on Saturday. By next season they&#8217;ll be a force to be dealt with, but 10 days after being hired will only produce a better team but probably not a winning team.

Go Hawksbee, we love to watch you. Have a good game.

**Prediction:**  
Lumberjax 13 and the Rush 11. A closer game than the last couple Jax home games, but a victory and Krispy Kremes will be had everyone.
