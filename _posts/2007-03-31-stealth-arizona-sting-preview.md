Okay, we&#8217;re actually just moments from face-off. Between the Final Four and dinner the afternoon got away from.

Here&#8217;s what&#8217;ll make a difference.

  * Is Arizona rested after last night&#8217;s game in Colorado? I sure hope not.
  * We need to let Dan Dawson get his goals, the more important thing is shutdown Dawson&#8217;s assists.
  * No rebound/trash goals. Curt Malawsky is usually good for one or two loose ball pick ups and goals on rebounds from shots. We need to stop that.
  * Cosmo keeps doing what he&#8217;s been doing the past month.
  * Blaser has been hit and miss this season, tonight will be a miss.

We&#8217;re a different team than when we played in the first half of the season. Cosmo is seeing shots well, the defense is used to each other and more importantly the offense is used to each other.

Everyone in the league has taken notice of our 5 game winning streak, so we&#8217;re not going to sneak up on anyone tonight. But we can still win it if we play just the same way that we have in the last 5 games.

So&#8230; I&#8217;ll go with Stealth winning 14-10.
