I&#8217;m going to depart from my previous content cycle of game previews and reviews. That same stuff is covered on the team sites, league site and the NLL Insiders so there&#8217;s nothing too ground breaking in my work there. It takes lots of effort and is time sensitive to get my previews up before games start and reviews up in a timely fashion. Changing things up relieves that pressure so I can just post what I want when I want and you&#8217;re stuck with it.

Since I watch more Western Division games than Eastern Division games I&#8217;m going to keep track of how the teams are stacking up out West with a Power Rankings each week. Ted Jenner is the only Insider out west, and I&#8217;m not by any means calling myself an Insider, but I watch a lot of Western Division NLL lacrosse so I&#8217;m going to talk about what I see in general. Right now, that&#8217;s an initial Power Ranking for all the teams out West.

**1) Minnesota Swarm (2-0)**<figure id="attachment_144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144" style="width: 75px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-144" title="minnesota" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minnesota.gif" alt="Minnesota Swarm" width="75" height="75" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/minnesota.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-144" class="wp-caption-text">Minnesota Swarm</figcaption></figure> 

Their previous time in the Eastern Division toughened them up for their first season out West. Maybe their schedule was favorable starting against a Portland team that hadn&#8217;t had any scrimmages against other teams and needed to find their own groove. In the Swarm&#8217;s second game they got a Stealth team that had played the night before and was a little tired and a little beat up. They beat both teams and looked pretty good doing it.  They have to play several Eastern teams in their upcoming schedule so their overall record might be skewed, but I&#8217;ll focus on their action against their Western foes.

**2) Calgary Roughnecks (3-0)**<figure id="attachment_139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-139" style="width: 75px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

Coach Troy Cordingley has the Roughnecks off to a very hot start. They might be a 1B to Minnesota&#8217;s 1A at this point. The downside that Calgary might have right now is they appear to be playing up to their potential. I don&#8217;t necessarily know whether they have room to improve. They beat the Stealth by 2 and Edmonton in OT. If/when those two teams improve and Calgary is already playing at their max potential, Calgary might not beat them again.  The Roughneck offense might be the best in the West right now.  I think the Roughnecks are one injury away from being a completely different team, but for now they&#8217;re cruising along.

**3) San Jose Stealth (0-2)**<figure id="attachment_132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132" style="width: 75px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

How is my winless team ranked above Edmonton and Portland? It is more than just being my favorite team.  Those two losses came to the top two teams and not a worse team. The Stealth defense was not a functional unit last weekend. They got torched on the Short Man and overall weren&#8217;t entirely cohesive. When they do come together I think they can beat the Roughnecks and give the Swarm a good battle. Until then, it&#8217;ll be a bumpy ride.  Just remember back to 2007 when the team had 14 new players and started 0-4 before going 9-3 the rest of the season and advancing to the Western finals.

**4) Edmonton Rush (1-1)**<figure id="attachment_154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154" style="width: 75px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-154" title="edmonton" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/edmonton.gif" alt="Edmonton Rush" width="75" height="75" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/edmonton.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-154" class="wp-caption-text">Edmonton Rush</figcaption></figure> 

The Rush are pretty equal to the Stealth. They actually had a closer loss to the Roughnecks than the Stealth did and they&#8217;ve got a win last night, but the Stealth should knock off Rochester Sunday night so they both have a win to balance this out so a zero win team is ahead of a 1 win team. Hamley has built a solid roster but doesn&#8217;t have a blockbuster star like Colin Doyle to push them to the top. They&#8217;ll do well, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ll be great.  Keep an eye on the kid Ryan Benesch, he had a good debut after one practice.  Next weekend they come back to Portland to finish the modified &#8220;home and home&#8221;.  A convincing win over the Jax might push them up in the rankings.

**5) Portland Lumberjax (1-3)**<figure id="attachment_155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155" style="width: 75px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-155" title="portland" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/portland.gif" alt="Portland Lumberjax" width="75" height="75" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/portland.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-155" class="wp-caption-text">Portland Lumberjax</figcaption></figure> 

They put a whooping on Colorado at their place, but lost a close one to Edmonton last night. They go where their defense takes them. Disher has been the best goalie in the West to start the season. The offense needs to be consistent every night.  They put 14 on the Mammoth with relative ease when Gee Nash had an off night.  In the other games they&#8217;ve scored 7, 10 and 10.  Double digits is not actually that bad considering the Lumberjax defensive potential but they failed to win those games so far.  A little more defense and a little more offense will swing the close games their way (yeah, I really went out on a limb there).

**6) Colorado Mammoth (1-1)**<figure id="attachment_153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153" style="width: 75px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-153" title="colorado" src="http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/colorado.gif" alt="Colorado Mammoth" width="75" height="75" />](http://thestealthdragon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/colorado.gif)<figcaption id="caption-attachment-153" class="wp-caption-text">Colorado Mammoth</figcaption></figure> 

The argument for the Mammoth this year is that they are younger than they&#8217;ve been in the past. But the argument against the Mammoth is that they lost way, way, way more experience on their defense (Josh Sims, Jim Moss and Pat Coyle) than can possibly be made up for in youth. Gee Nash is an All Star when he&#8217;s on, when he&#8217;s off even the Lumberjax can jump out to a 7-1 lead on him. Last season Chris Levis came in to save the day. In 2009, it&#8217;s Andrew Leyshon&#8217;s job to be the backup and he&#8217;s no Chris Levis.  Might be a long season for the league&#8217;s largest  crowds.
